                I Love Computers.
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
                Computers have been my interest for as long as I can remember. I started coded quite recently,
                but I always liked to do other things on my computer, like playing video games. I first discovered computers 
                when I was quite young, fascinated at how they functioned. During the pandemic, I had grown comfortable
                with computers and found a sense of calm when I was around them. I knew how to work them.
                Having something so powerful at the click of a button or the opening of a lid was and still is extremely
                exciting to me.<br><br>
                That's why I coded this website today. To explain why I love computers so much and to show how I can build
                my entire career out of them.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-danger my-4">
                How it started:
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
                My interest in computers and coding in general came when I was young. I discovered this website called
                <span class="text-danger">Codecademy</span> which teaches you how to code. I found this free course on 
                <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python-for-programmers" class="text-danger">Python</a> that 
                would help me get started. I went on to learn how to code receipts and really cool stuff in Python,
                but then I let go of the hobby as I was 9 at the time and couldn't hold on to something for more 
                than a month. I recently picked up the hobby again as I signed up for a coding class after regaining my interest.
                Now I was learning a different language: HTML. HTML is <i>Hyper Text Markup Language</i> and is the base of almost
                every website out there. I made this website with HTML and a CSS library called Bootstrap. It's quite easy to learn,
                and it allows me to make websites easily for my projects. You may have noticed that almost every single project
                I've made for I.L.A. has been a website, but that's just because I'm so good at it. It's extremely reliable
                and allows me to get content out really quickly.

                How I Can Use This Hobby:
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
                There are many jobs that allow me to use my hobby in the future. A job that I'm looking forward to is a software
                developer. They program all sorts of cool things, and there are a ton of famous people surrounding the 
                job. Some include:

                                Bill Gates created a version of <code>BASIC</code>, a type of programming language, and it was
                            the first product Microsoft sold. Fun Fact: Bill Gates is the most loved billionaires in the world!
                            You can see why I strive to be like him now.

                                although spelled 'Linus', is actually pronounced 'Linux' like the operating system. The logo of Linux is actually
                                a penguin drawn from a competition for the logo. Hilarious!
